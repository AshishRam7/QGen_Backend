Given that Breadth-First Search (BFS) is used to find the shortest path between users, justify the choice of BFS over Dijkstra's algorithm, considering factors such as the nature of the connections (unweighted edges) and the potential for large numbers of users.  Critically evaluate the efficiency and scalability of BFS in this context, supporting your arguments with specific considerations of time and space complexity.",

However, they lack crucial information for a CS undergraduate to justify the choice of BFS over Dijkstra's for unweighted graphs in a large social network.  The question demands a comparative analysis of time and space complexity of both algorithms in this specific context, which is not supported by the snippets.  While the student might recall some aspects of BFS and Dijkstra's, the snippets do not provide the necessary detail to construct a complete and accurate evaluation at the 'Evaluate' Bloom's Taxonomy level."
