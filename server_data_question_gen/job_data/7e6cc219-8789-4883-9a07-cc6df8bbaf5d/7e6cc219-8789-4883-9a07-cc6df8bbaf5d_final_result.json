The connections between nodes are represented by arrows, indicating relationships or interactions. The graph also includes a trend of increasing values from node 1 to node 4, with node 2 and 3 having intermediate values.\n---\n\n\n| From |   | To |   |\n|------|---|----|---|\n| 1    | 2 | 3  | 5 |\n| 2    | 3 | 5  |   |\n| 3    | 2 |    |   |\n| 4    | 2 | 5  |   |\n| 5    |   |    |   |",
