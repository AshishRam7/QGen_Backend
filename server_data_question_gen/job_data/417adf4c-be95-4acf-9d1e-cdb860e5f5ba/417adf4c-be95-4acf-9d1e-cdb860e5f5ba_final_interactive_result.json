The SPT tree is constructed by starting with the source node and traversing the graph, adding edges to the tree as it explores the possible paths. The edges are labeled with the node identifiers, and the tree branches out into multiple paths, each representing a possible route to the destination.  In this particular SPT tree, the nodes are labeled with the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes, with the node 'a' connected to nodes 'b', 'c', and 'd', and node 'b' connected to nodes 'c', 'd', and 'e'. The tree branches out into multiple paths, with each path representing a different route to the destination.  The diagram illustrates the concept of a shortest path tree, which is useful in various applications, such as network optimization, routing, and logistics.

For n number of vertices in a graph, there are (n - 1)! number of possibilities.\n\nInstead of brute-force using dynamic programming approach, the solution can be obtained in lesser time, though there is no polynomial time algorithm.\n\nLet us consider a graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of cities and E is a set of weighted edges. An edge e(u, v) represents that vertices u and v are connected. Distance between vertex u and v is d(u, v), which should be non-negative.\n\nSuppose we have started at city 1 and after visiting some cities now we are in city j. Hence, this is a partial tour. We certainly need to know j, since this will determine which cities are most convenient to visit next. We also need to know all the cities visited so far, so that we don't repeat any of them. Hence, this is an appropriate sub-problem.\n\nFor a subset of cities S \u0404 {1, 2, 3, ... , n} that includes 1, and j \u0404 S, let C(S, j) be the length of the shortest path visiting each node in S exactly once, starting at 1 and ending at j.\n\nWhen |S| > 1, we define C(S, 1) = \u221d since the path cannot start and end at 1.\n\nNow, let express C(S, j) in terms of smaller sub-problems.

The SPT tree is constructed by starting with the source node and traversing the graph, adding edges to the tree as it explores the possible paths. The edges are labeled with the node identifiers, and the tree branches out into multiple paths, each representing a possible route to the destination.  In this particular SPT tree, the nodes are labeled with the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes, with the node 'a' connected to nodes 'b', 'c', and 'd', and node 'b' connected to nodes 'c', 'd', and 'e'. The tree branches out into multiple paths, with each path representing a different route to the destination.  The diagram illustrates the concept of a shortest path tree, which is useful in various applications, such as network optimization, routing, and logistics. It provides a visual representation of the possible paths between two nodes and highlights the structure of the tree, making it easier to understand and analyze the relationships between the nodes.\n---",
