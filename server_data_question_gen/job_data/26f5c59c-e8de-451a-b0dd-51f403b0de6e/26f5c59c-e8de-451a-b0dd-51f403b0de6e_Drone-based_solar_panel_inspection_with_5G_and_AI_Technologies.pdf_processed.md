**Abstract**

It's been considered an incomplete task for years to maintain large solar power plants for years. Presented here is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based defects detection of Photovoltaic(PV) modules using Thermal Images (TI) darknet YOLOV4 object detection, which can be processed in two ways: (1) Creating a huge number of high-resolution TI samples using a huge number of TI generation methods; and (2) using the generated TI's, to develop an efficient method of defects classification. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) technology and traditional image processing technology are combined to result in the TI object detection method. This method has a capability of training a large number of highresolution TI samples to give a good AI model output. Then, CNN is used to extract the deep feature of TI to show the defected cells. In other hand using enhanced 5G technology it is used to operate the drone for long range and by help of AI, can send the defected cells location to the ground station. Compared to other solutions, using it can improve PV module inspection and health management solutions significantly. It has been demonstrated experimentally that the proposed AIbased solution is efficient and accurate at detecting defects using TI and drones automatically.

## **Introduction**

Being in the modern and technological world, the world's population is increasing day by day. This causes the energy challenge in the living world. In addition to finding alternatives to fossil fuels, we must look for green and renewable energy sources too [1]. Bearing in mind, that we are in the technological world, obtaining energy from solar power plants has gotten recognition. And on the other hand, the establishment of solar panels has become an easy task. But, it needs systematic inspection and maintenance also. Many researchers have been examined the inspection and maintenance of their ways. Due to the fact that deep learningbased approaches for classifying and detecting objects have been proposed in recent years [2]. So, considering the hands-ontechnology world we implemented Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to do real-time inspection and detection of solar panel defects and failures. In this paper, will discuss all about the methodology, implementation, experiments, and results of real-time detection of solar panel defects and failures using AI system in UAV.

# **Inspection methods and types of failures in solar power plants**

# *A. Types of PV failures*

Obstruction that occurs in PV plants includes cracks, cell failure, delamination, failure due to shadows, failure due to weeds, delamination, string failure, mismatches, snail tracks, and cluster failures. When these failures or defects occur in a solar cell, they cause abnormal heat that generates in the solar cell. Figure 1 shows an example of a solar cell crack.

The image presents a close-up view of a heat-sensitive surface, likely a sensor or detector, exhibiting a pattern of dark and bright regions. The bright areas appear to be concentrated in specific areas, while the darker regions are more evenly distributed. The surface shows signs of thermal expansion and contraction, with some areas appearing slightly raised or elevated. The numerical values visible are relatively low, indicating a low-temperature environment. Overall, the image highlights the thermal properties of the material and suggests potential applications in fields such as electronics, sensors, or biomedical devices.

## *B. Types of Inspection Methods*

Illustrative methods for detecting defected or failed solar panels include visual inspection method, I-V measurement, Electroluminescence, Infrared Thermography, UAV with a thermal camera, Real-Time analysis, and Data Acquisition System (DAS), Real-Time analysis with UAV and Thermal Camera. But, choosing an efficient, effective,time-saving, and reliable method is a difficult task. So, after some literature survey and comparison methods, choosing the right inspection was UAV with a thermal camera.

## **Inspection by UAV with Thermal Camera**

## *A. How to detect and send the location of defected solar panel*

We aimed to do an automated inspection of the solar power plant by importing a mission to UAV and to get the report using thermal and RGB images which will be a more efficient and effective way of inspection. UAV inspection consists of shooting detection and sending real-time location.

On the first hand, we initialized to take defected panel images using a quad-copter (UAV) and FLIR DUO PRO R thermal camera. Next step we used AI to detect the failed and defective solar panels. At this time, we used Python, OpenCV, and Darknet YOLO-V4 (You Only Look Once) to detection. Finally, yet importantly, we get the real-time GPS location of a defected or failed solar panel by a drone using python. In this work, we stated that it is possible to detect failed or defected solar panels automatically using a normalized image-processing library and deep learning program.

# *B. Equipment Used*

We used a quadcopter (drone), shown in Figure 2, and a FLIR Duo Pro R (Thermal camera). 640 by 512 pixels resolutions and 30 frames per second (fps) are the features of FLIR duo Pro R. In addition, a 3-axis gimbal is attached to it.

The image shows a red and black drone equipped with a camera and a remote control. The drone is positioned on a gray floor, with a small screen displaying a video feed. The drone's design suggests it is likely used for aerial surveying or monitoring, possibly in a controlled environment like a hangar or laboratory. The camera appears to be a multi-camera system, possibly for enhanced stability and data collection. The remote control is likely used for controlling the drone's movements and data acquisition. Overall, the image highlights the integration of advanced technology in drone design for specific applications.

## *C. Thermal and RGB images*

When a solar panel is defected or failed, abnormal heat will be generated in the solar panel. That abnormal heat will be detected using thermographic images, which include hotspots, cracks, and other types of cell failures also. Figure 3 describes a hotspot caused by bird shits. An area of high resistance obscured by weeds and dirt generates electric current, which generates abnormal heat in that area. The generated current on a panel cannot pass if a cluster failure, a panel failure, or a string failure occurs because of the failure of the electric circuit. The generated current will be directly converted into heat, which causes the hotspot.

**Original Image Reference in Document:** `_page_1_Picture_7.jpeg` (Alt: ``)

**Figure Description (Generated by Moondream):**
The image displays a close-up view of a grid-like structure, likely a solar panel array, with alternating purple and orange panels. The purple panels appear to be emitting a faint, reddish glow, possibly indicating a temperature difference or a specific condition within the panels. The orange panels appear darker, suggesting a lower temperature or a different material composition. The grid pattern is regular and uniform, with the purple and orange panels arranged in a consistent offset pattern. The image suggests a thermal imaging or infrared analysis, potentially revealing temperature variations or heat distribution within the solar panel array.

## *E. Defected or Failed Image Classification*

The number of data sets of thermal images were collected and labeled using label.img software. Python OpenCV was used for image processing. We classified the labels as solar panel and solar cell failure. All the labeled images were trained, and trained images weights were used for object detection. The sample data, which consists of 1000 thermal images, which includes 641 cell failures. Approximately 90% of the image data were used for learning, and 10% for verification as shown in Figure 4.

## *F. Training and output*

The image data training has been completed using NVIDIA GPU TESLA K8 using darknet yolo-v4 and yolo convolution neural network (YOLO-CNN-29). In Figure 5, the number of epochs and their accuracy is shown. When yolo-CNN-29 learned 18 epochs, the accuracy has attained 100%. These trained weights are used to do object classification.

## *G. Real-Time Detection*

To detect failures and defects of solar panels, we have many ways, but the implemented way here is to assemble the quadcopter with FLIR Duo Pro R thermal camera embedded with NVIDIA Jetson Nano and 3-axis gimbal. By artificial intelligence and an embedded system, the REAL-TIME LOCATION (position) of the defected cell will be sent to the ground station, and the defected cell or the good cell can be identified with an embedded system (Thermal Image Classification). The system architecture was shown as in Figure 6. And, the entire real-time detection process was carried out as shown in Figure 7.

**Figure Description (Generated by Moondream):**
This figure presents a model architecture for predicting solar panel performance using YOLO-v4-CONV.29. The model is composed of three main components: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Max Pooling Layer, and a Leaky ReLU activation function. The CNN is trained on a dataset of solar panels, while the Max Pooling Layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input. The Leaky ReLU activation function is included to prevent the model from becoming too sensitive to small changes in the input. The model's performance is evaluated using a validation dataset, and the final prediction is compared to the actual solar panel performance. Overall, the model demonstrates a high level of accuracy and robustness, with a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to traditional deep learning architectures.

### Figure 10

**Original Image Reference in Document:** `_page_3_Figure_9.jpeg` (Alt: ``)

**Figure Description (Generated by Moondream):**
The image shows a solar panel array with a significant number of damaged cells, specifically a cluster of cells labeled "cell failure." This cluster is located near the center of the panel and is surrounded by a larger, intact panel. The image also highlights the presence of a "solar panel" in the top left corner, suggesting that the damage is not limited to a single area. The overall visual suggests a decline in the efficiency of the solar panel system, with a notable decrease in the number of functioning cells.

A function will be developed in the future for getting the GPS location of defective cell and to map the defected location using PiX4D*.*

# **Conclusion**

In order to provide a more accurate and efficient method of detecting failed solar panels, we compared several methods and determined after several literature studies, a literature survey, and experiments, drone with thermal camera integrated with AI is the most efficient and effective. Although the confidence level of cell failure was low, it has increased to 89% after the mean Average Precision was increased to 100%. We expect that of getting GPS location of a defected solar panel during inspection.
