Your algorithm should use a modified Breadth-First Search approach and minimize communication overhead between machines. Describe the algorithm, including data structures, communication protocols, and pseudocode for each machine's operation. Analyze the algorithm's scalability and its performance compared to a centralized shortest path algorithm.",

However, they lack the information necessary for a Computer Science undergraduate to design a distributed algorithm for finding the shortest path in a large, partitioned graph. The question requires knowledge of distributed systems, communication protocols, and algorithm design at a level far beyond what these snippets provide.  The snippets focus on fundamental graph concepts, not the complexities of distributed computing needed to answer the 'Create' level question."
