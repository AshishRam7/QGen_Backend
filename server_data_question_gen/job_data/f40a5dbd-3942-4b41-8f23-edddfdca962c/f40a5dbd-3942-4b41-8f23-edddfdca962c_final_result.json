They are debating between using a purely recursive algorithm, a memoized recursive algorithm, and a dynamic programming approach to solve the optimization problem.  Evaluate the suitability of each approach, considering factors such as the size of the problem instance (number of resources and tasks), the potential for overlapping subproblems, and the importance of finding an optimal solution versus a near-optimal solution within a reasonable timeframe.  Justify your recommendation for the most appropriate algorithm, considering the trade-offs between efficiency and solution quality.",

The snippets describe the characteristics of dynamic programming (overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure), its advantages over divide-and-conquer, and the steps involved in designing a dynamic programming algorithm.  While the snippets don't explicitly address cloud resource allocation, they equip the student with the conceptual tools to evaluate the suitability of each approach for this problem, considering factors like problem size, overlapping subproblems, and the trade-off between solution optimality and computational time. This aligns with the 'Evaluate' level of Bloom's taxonomy, requiring the student to synthesize information and make reasoned judgments."
