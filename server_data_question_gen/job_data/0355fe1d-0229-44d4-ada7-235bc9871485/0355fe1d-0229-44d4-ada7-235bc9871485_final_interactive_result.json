Design a system using Breadth-First Search and a shortest path algorithm to dynamically reroute vehicles around unexpected obstacles (represented as temporarily unavailable edges).  Your design should consider factors such as real-time updates, minimizing overall travel time, and handling potential conflicts between vehicle routes.  Detail the data structures you would use and justify your algorithmic choices.",

While they mention concepts like shortest path trees and directed graphs, they lack the depth and breadth required for a postgraduate Computer Science Engineering student to design a complete system for dynamically rerouting autonomous vehicles. The question demands a sophisticated understanding of real-time updates, conflict resolution, and the integration of BFS and a shortest path algorithm, which are not sufficiently addressed in the given snippets.  The snippets are insufficient to support the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy, which requires generating a novel solution based on a deep understanding of the concepts, not just recognizing or applying them from simple examples."
