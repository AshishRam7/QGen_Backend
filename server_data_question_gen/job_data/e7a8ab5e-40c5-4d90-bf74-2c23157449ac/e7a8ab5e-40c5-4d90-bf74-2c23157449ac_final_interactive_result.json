The SPT tree is constructed by starting with the source node and the destination node, and then adding edges to the tree in a specific order. The edges are labeled with the source and destination nodes, as well as the weight of the edge, which represents the cost of traversing that path.  In this particular SPT tree, the nodes are labeled with the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. The edges are labeled with the corresponding weights, indicating the cost of traversing each path. The tree is constructed in a way that the edges are added in a specific order, starting from the source node and ending at the destination node.  The SPT tree is a useful tool for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a network, as it allows for efficient computation of the shortest path between any two nodes in the network.\n---",

For n number of vertices in a graph, there are (n - 1)! number of possibilities.\n\nInstead of brute-force using dynamic programming approach, the solution can be obtained in lesser time, though there is no polynomial time algorithm.\n\nLet us consider a graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of cities and E is a set of weighted edges. An edge e(u, v) represents that vertices u and v are connected. Distance between vertex u and v is d(u, v), which should be non-negative.\n\nSuppose we have started at city 1 and after visiting some cities now we are in city j. Hence, this is a partial tour. We certainly need to know j, since this will determine which cities are most convenient to visit next. We also need to know all the cities visited so far, so that we don't repeat any of them. Hence, this is an appropriate sub-problem.\n\nFor a subset of cities S \u0404 {1, 2, 3, ... , n} that includes 1, and j \u0404 S, let C(S, j) be the length of the shortest path visiting each node in S exactly once, starting at 1 and ending at j.\n\nWhen |S| > 1, we define C(S, 1) = \u221d since the path cannot start and end at 1.\n\nNow, let express C(S, j) in terms of smaller sub-problems. We need to start at 1 and end at j. We should select the next city in such a way that\n\nC(S,j) = min C(S\u2212{j},i)+d(i,j)\n\nwhere i\u2208 S and i\u2260j\n\nc(S,j) = min C(s\u2212{j},i)+d(i,j)\n\nwhere i\u2208 S and i\u2260j",

The SPT tree is constructed by starting with the source node and the destination node, and then adding edges to the tree in a specific order. The edges are labeled with the source and destination nodes, as well as the weight of the edge, which represents the cost of traversing that path.  In this particular SPT tree, the nodes are labeled with the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. The edges are labeled with the corresponding weights, indicating the cost of traversing each path. The tree is constructed in a way that the edges are added in a specific order, starting from the source node and ending at the destination node.  The SPT tree is a useful tool for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a network, as it allows for efficient computation of the shortest path between any two nodes in the network.\n---",
