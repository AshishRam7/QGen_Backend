#### Figure Description: Figure 2 presents a tree-based backtracking algorithm. The figure shows a tree structure with a root node and branches extending to child nodes. The tree is used to represent a graph, with each node representing a vertex and each edge representing a connection between vertices. The backtracking algorithm traverses the tree, starting from the root node and exploring all possible paths to the target node. The figure highlights the efficiency of the tree-based approach, as evidenced by the minimal number of nodes traversed compared to other graph traversal methods. In this example we drew a figure 2 of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called *depth-first tree searching.*)
