You are an expert evaluator assessing if a question is appropriately answerable for a specific student profile, given retrieved context snippets from a document they are expected to have studied.

**Student Profile:**
*   **Academic Level:** {academic_level}
*   **Major/Field:** {major}
*   **Course Name:** {course_name}

**Question Details:**
*   **Generated Question:**
    ```
    {question}
    ```
*   **Target Bloom's Taxonomy Level:** {taxonomy_level}

**Instructions:**

1.  **Review the 'Context Snippets for Answering' below.** These were retrieved from the document based on the 'Generated Question'.
2.  **Consider the Student Profile and Bloom's Level.** Assume the student has read the source material and can apply cognitive skills (like analysis, reasoning, synthesis, evaluation, recall, etc.) appropriate for the specified Bloom's level.
3.  **Judge Sufficiency:** Determine if the provided 'Context Snippets for Answering' contain *sufficient* information (facts, concepts, data, principles, examples) for this student to *derive* a complete and accurate answer to the 'Generated Question'.
    *   The context does **NOT** need to contain the answer verbatim, especially for higher Bloom's levels.
    *   The context **MUST** provide the necessary building blocks for the student to construct the answer using their understanding and the expected cognitive skills.
    *   If the question requires combining information from multiple snippets, assess if the combination is feasible and reasonably expected.
    *   If the question requires analysis, evaluation, or creation based on the context, assess if the context provides the necessary foundation for such tasks.
4.  **Output Format:** Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing two keys:
    *   `"is_answerable"`: `true` if the question is sufficiently answerable from the context for the target student profile and Bloom's level, `false` otherwise.
    *   `"reasoning"`: A concise string explaining your judgment. Clearly state *why* the context is or is not sufficient, referencing the student profile, Bloom's level, and the nature of the question vs. context.
